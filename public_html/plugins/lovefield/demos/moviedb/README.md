* Step 3: Pull dependencies in bower.json, ```bower install```
* Step 4: Start a local webserver, ```gulp debug```

## demo-jquery

Lovefield + jquery demo, demonstrates table joins.

## demo-binding

Demonstrates Lovefield's parametrized queries + observers features.


## demo-pureidb

Same as demo-jquery but instead of using Lovefield, IDB is used directly (for
timing and code size/complexity comparison).
